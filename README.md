EDD Related Downloads
=====================

Show related downloads by tag or category.

This is an extension for [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) that automatically adds related downloads after the single download content on the single download page. 
It is simple and light. It works by default without a need for any settings. By default, 3 related downloads will be shown, related by download_tag. The title and featured image will be displayed, centered nicely. 

Unobtrusive Styling - Fits right into your theme
------------------------------------------------

- The featured images adopt your theme's style for `.wp-post-image`.
- You can modify the image style with this selector: `#isa-related-downloads img `
- Responsive CSS is included so it looks good on any size screen.

Filter by Category or Tag
-------------------------

There is only one setting for this plugin, and it's optional. By default, downloads are related by category. You can checkmark this option to choose to filter by tag instead. The option is located at `Downloads --> Settings --> Misc tab`.
